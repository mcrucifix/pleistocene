\details{
Site 1143 is located at 9d21.72'N, 113d11'E, at a water depth of 
2772 m within a basin on the southern continental margin of the 
South China Sea. Three holes were cored at the site and combined into 
a composite (spliced) stratigraphic section that documents complete re- 
covery for the upper 190.85 meters composite depth, the interval of ad- 
vanced piston coring (Wang, Prell, Blum, et al., 2000; Wang et al., 
2001). The early Pliocene to Holocene sediment sequence provided 
abundant and well-preserved calcareous microfossils and offered an ex- 
cellent opportunity to establish foraminiferal stable isotope records. 
Here, we present benthic and planktonic d18O and d13C records that 
cover the last 5 m.y. These data sets will provide an important basis for
upcoming studies to generate an orbitally tuned oxygen isotope stratig- 
raphy and examine long- and short-term changes in deep and surface
water mass signatures (temperature, salinity, and nutrients) with an av-
erage sample spacing of ~2.9 k.y. for the benthic and ~2.6 k.y. for the
planktonic records. }

\note{The record is very framentary, and difficult to use for dynamical system calibration purposes}
