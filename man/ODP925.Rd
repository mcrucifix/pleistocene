Core recovery (%): 102.1 
Oldest sediment cored: 
Depth (mbsf): 54.50 
Nature: clayey nannofossil ooze with foraminifers 
Age: late Pliocene 
Measured velocity (km/s): 1.6 
Principal results: Site 925 is the shallowest of the depth transect of sites on 
the Ceara Rise. The site is located beneath warm surface waters that have 
a mean temperature around 27 deg C. The seafloor at a depth of 3040 m is 
bathed by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) well above the carbonate 
lysocline. The site was chosen to provide material for investigating the 
geological history of surface- and deep-water properties in the region. 
Five holes were drilled at Site 925. Hole 925 A was cored with the RCB 
from 303.7 to 930.4 mbsf, with spot cores between 101.8 and 110.0 mbsf 
and between 197.9 and 207.5 mbsf. The hole was logged from 300 to 907 
mbsf. Hole 925B was cored with the APC from the mud line to 318.0 mbsf. 
Hole 925C was cored with the APC from the mud line to 321.5 mbsf and 
then with the XCB to 360.1 mbsf. Hole 925D was cored with the APC from 
2.5 to 354.0 mbsf to ensure complete recovery of the section and to provide 
sufficient core material for high-resolution, shore-based investigations. 
Hole 925E was cored with the APC from the mud line to 54.5 mbsf, 
primarily to provide material for high-resolution interstitial-water sam- 
pling. Detailed comparisons between the magnetic susceptibility records 
generated on the MST track, and high-resolution color reflectance gener- 
ated using a hand-held Minolta color analyzer, demonstrated that the 
sedimentary sequence to 370 mbsf had been completely recovered. In the 
composite section that was generated for the site, the deepest part (about 
320-360 mbsf) was based on parallel cores recovered using three different 
drilling methods: APC, XCB, and RCB. The segments recovered by the 
RCB are so good that they make up a unique yardstick against which the 
distortions generated by APC and XCB coring may be evaluated. In 
Site 925 was the shallowest of a transect of sites drilled on the Ceara 
Rise (see fig. 2, "Introduction" chapter, this volume). The site is in 
an area of uniform relief; hydrosweep bathymetry coverage shows a 
range of only 20 m for several kilometers in all directions around the 
site (Fig. 1). The seismic section (Fig. 2) includes an upper layered 
sequence down to about 0.3 s (200 m); a middle more seismically 
incoherent unit between about 0.3 and 0.9 s (300-800 m); a unit with 
some parallel reflectors between 0.9 and 1.3 s (800-1300 m); and a 
fairly prominent reflector at around 1.3 s (1300 m) that appears to 
represent the base of the pelagic section. The deepest objective of 
drilling, time permitting, was to sample this reflector at 1300 m in the 
hope that it would provide constraints on the depth history of the rise. 
Drilling to this depth would also provide information on the nature of 
the rise soon after it was formed (e.g., whether it was subaerially 
exposed or covered by reefs). Above that reflector our aim was to 
recover the entire stratigraphic sequence so that we could obtain mate- 
rial useful for investigating the history of surface paleoceanography of 
the region as well as data from the shallowest member of a depth 
transect designed to record the detailed history of changes in deep- 
water physical and chemical properties in the western North Atlantic 
Ocean. We were particularly concerned about obtaining a truly com- 
plete section, with abundant material available for high-resolution 
sampling, of the uppermost part of the sediment column. We aimed to 
sample this upper section in triplicate with the APC to provide the 
means for high resolution investigation of the whole of the late Neo- 
gene. Oceanographic conditions in this region have probably been 
directly affected by the closure of the Panama Isthmus and uplift of 
the Andes during this time, in addition to having been affected by the 
globally pervasive effect of increased glaciation. The sediments were 
also expected to preserve a detailed history of the transport of ter- 
rigenous matter to the Atlantic Ocean by the Amazon River.
