\details{
Site 1090 is also located on the Agulhas Ridge at 42d54.8'S, 8d54'E in a water depth of 3702 m (Fig. F1). A composite oxygen isotope record was developed at the location of ODP Site 1090 by splicing piston core TTN057-6-PC4 and Site 1090 at ~12.1 mcd (Fig. F8). The piston core was collected during the site survey cruise for Leg 177 and is at same position as Site 1090. The piston core has a complete record through MIS 12 (~440 ka) (Hodell et al., 2000) with sedimentation rates averaging 3 cm/k.y. The piston core was sampled at an interval of every 3 cm, yielding a temporal resolution of one sample every 1000 yr. The composite section of Site 1090 was sampled at 5-cm intervals (beginning at ~9 mcd to provide overlap with core TTN057-6), resulting in an average sampling frequency of one sample per 3 k.y. for the 2.8-m.y. record (Venz and Hodell, 2002). Sedimentation rates average ~3 cm/k.y. in the Pleistocene (0 to ~1.2 Ma), resulting in temporal resolution of one sample every 2 k.y. Prior to 1.2 Ma, sedimentation rates were lower (average = ~1.2 cm/k.y.) and yielded an average sampling frequency of one sample per 4 k.y.

Stable isotopes were measured on the benthic foraminifer Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Cibicidoides kullenbergi as well as the planktonic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides (Table T4) (Hodell et al., 2000; Venz and Hodell, 2002). Tests of Cibicidoides were picked from the >212-micro-m size fraction, and one to three individuals were used for analysis. Specimens of G. bulloides were selected from the >212- to <300-micro-m size fraction, and eight to ten individuals were used for analysis.

For the last 450 k.y., the age model for the core TTN057-6/Site 1090 composite was derived by correlating the 18O signal to Site 607 using the modified timescale of Mix et al. (1995). The correlation of the core TTN057-6/Site 1090 oxygen isotopic record to the reference signals is good at the stage level for the last 2 m.y. (Fig. F9), although brief hiatuses occur in the Pleistocene (Table T5). Correlation between ~2.0 and 2.9 Ma is less certain owing to low sedimentation rates, hiatuses, and the absence of Cibicidoides in some samples.
