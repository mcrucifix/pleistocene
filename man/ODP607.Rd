\details{
s607ageCK92isoadjmean.txt = This is data originally published by Raymo et al. [1989], Ruddiman et al. [1989], and Raymo [1992]. As described in Ruddiman et al. [1989], the uppermost part of record (0-915 cm) consists of a composite stack of previously published piston core data. For levels with duplicate analyses, the mean of the data is given. The Pleistocene interval includes both uvigerina and cibicidoides data (a data file with only cibicidoides data is given below). To correct for species offsets: in the 607C13 column, the uvigerina data has had 0.9 per mil added to it and in the 607O18 column 0.64 per mil has been subtracted from the uvigerina data. In the 607O18adj column 0.64 per mil has been added to cibicidoides data. Species adjustments after Shackleton and Hall [1984]. Please note that the 607 d18O data published in Ruddiman et al. [1986] was run on an earlier model mass spec, was found to be quite noisy, and eventually was all discarded and rerun.}
