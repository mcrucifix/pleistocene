Principal results: Site 927 is the second shallowest of the depth transect of sites 
on the Ceara Rise and also the site closest to the modern Amazon River. The 
site is located beneath warm surface waters having a mean temperature 
around 27dC. The seafloor at a depth of 3315 m is bathed by North Atlantic 
Deep Water (NADW) well above the present-day carbonate lysocline. The 
site was chosen to provide material for investigating the geologic history of 
surface- and deep-water properties in the region. 
Three holes were drilled at Site 927. Hole 927A was cored with the Af C 
to 312.5 mbsf. Hole 927B was cored with the APC from the mud line to 261.5 
mbsf. Hole 927C was cored with the APC from the mud line to 228 mbsf 
and extended with the XCB to 266.7 mbsf. Hole 927C was deepened to 358 
mbsf to enable the whole of the cored section to be logged, which it subse- 
quently was with the Quad combination tool. Detailed comparisons between 
the magnetic susceptibility records generated on the MST, and high-resolution 
color reflectance generated using a handheld Minolta color analyzer, demon- 
strated complete recovery of the sedimentary sequence to 266 mbsf. 
The recovered sedimentary sequence at Site 927 spans the interval 
from the early middle Miocene to the Holocene without any stratigraphic 
break detected, except for a clear hiatus between about 13 and 15 Ma. The 
entire sequence is characterized by rhythmic sedimentary cycles, and a 
preliminary evaluation suggests that these are chiefly related to the orbital 
precession cycle. These sedimentary cycles were well recorded by mag- 
netic susceptibility, color, and natural gamma-ray emission, and closely 
resemble the coeval cycles recorded in Sites 925 and 926. All these three 
parameters were shown to record variations in the ratio of terrigenous 
material to biogenic carbonate in the sediments. Because of a pervasive 
magnetic overprint, it proved impossible to obtain any magnetostrati- 
graphic data for the site. 
Biostratigraphic age control was provided by calcareous nannofossils 
and foraminifers throughout.
